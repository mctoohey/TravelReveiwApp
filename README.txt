Instructions to run the app.
1. Ensure an instance of the reference server is running on localhost:4941 (although this can be changed in src/api.js).
2. Make sure the current directory is 'travel-review-app'.
3. Run 'npm install' and wait for the required dependencies to install (this may take a couple of minutes, make sure internet enabler is enabled).
4. Run 'npm run dev' the app should now be accessable at localhost:8080 (or whatever port it says when the command is run).
